# 🏙️ Hyderabad House Rent Prediction 🧠💸

> A data science deep dive into the city of biryani, tech dreams, and skyrocketing rent prices.

Welcome to **Hyderabad House Rent Prediction**, a full-fledged machine learning project aimed at predicting monthly rental prices based on real-world housing data. From raw CSVs to clean predictions — this project showcases data wrangling, visualization, regression modeling, and a sprinkle of ML finesse.

## 📊 Dataset

**Source**: [Kaggle Dataset — Hyderabad Rent](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammedabdulazeem/house-rent-prediction-for-hyderabad)

**Features include:**
- `BHK`, `Size`, `Area Type`, `Location`
- `Furnishing Status`, `Tenant Type`, `Bathroom`
- And of course, the **monthly rent** in INR 💸

## 💼 Problem Statement

Can we accurately predict rental prices in Hyderabad using available features?  
This project aims to:
- Identify key factors influencing rent
- Build and evaluate predictive regression models
- Provide data-driven insights for renters, landlords, and real estate investors
