# 🏙️ Hyderabad House Rent Prediction 🧠💸  
*A data science deep dive into the city of biryani, tech dreams, and skyrocketing rent.*

Welcome to **Hyderabad House Rent Prediction** — a machine learning journey where raw CSVs transform into actionable real estate insights. This project demonstrates a full ML pipeline: from wrangling chaotic housing data to deploying polished predictions.

🔗 **Dataset Source:**  
[Kaggle: Hyderabad Rent Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammedabdulazeem/house-rent-prediction-for-hyderabad)

## 📌 Objective

**Goal:**  
Predict monthly rental prices (in INR ₹) using real-world housing data in Hyderabad.

**Why it matters:**  
- Help **renters** identify fair deals  
- Assist **landlords** in pricing smartly  
- Empower **investors** with data-driven rental ROI

## 🚀 ML Workflow

1. 📥 **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   Handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables  
2. 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualize trends by location, size, BHK, and more  
3. 🏗️ **Feature Engineering**  
   Extract meaningful signals from raw attributes  
4. 🤖 **Model Training & Tuning**  
   Compare regression models and tune hyperparameters  
5. 📈 **Evaluation**  
   Use MAE, RMSE, and R² to judge model performance  
6. 🌍 **Insights & Business Value**  
   Highlight rental hotspots, affordability ranges, etc.

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Meaning                            | Why It Matters                          |
|--------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| MAE    | Mean Absolute Error                 | Measures average prediction error        |
| RMSE   | Root Mean Squared Error             | Penalizes large errors more              |
| R²     | Coefficient of Determination        | Explains how well variance is captured   |
